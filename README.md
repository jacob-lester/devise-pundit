Vision
-----------
We envision a next generation educational social network site for NKU students, NKUNet, so that students can share vast knowledge and resources with each other. This educational social network aims to break down barriers by creating forums in which students can participate and seek guidance regarding their courses from not only their peers but also faculty members alike.
